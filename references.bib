              methods have focused on women. Male contraception by means of
              hormonal and non hormonal methods is an attractive alternative.
              Hormonal methods of contraception using testosterone have shown
              good results. Non hormonal reversible methods of male
              contraception like reversible inhibition of sperm under
              guidanceare very promising. In this article we have reviewed the
